      <abstract>
        <p>Research on fall and movement detection with wearable devices has witnessed promising growth. However, there are few publicly available datasets, all recorded with smartphones, which are insufficient for testing new proposals due to their absence of objective population, lack of performed activities, and limited information. Here, we present a dataset of falls and activities of daily living (ADLs) acquired with a self-developed device composed of two types of accelerometer and one gyroscope. It consists of 19 ADLs and 15 fall types performed by 23 young adults, 15 ADL types performed by 14 healthy and independent participants over 62 years old, and data from one participant of 60 years old that performed all ADLs and falls. These activities were selected based on a survey and a literature analysis. We test the dataset with widely used feature extraction and a simple to implement threshold based classification, achieving up to 96% of accuracy in fall detection. An individual activity analysis demonstrates that most errors coincide in a few number of activities where new approaches could be focused. Finally, validation tests with elderly people significantly reduced the fall detection performance of the tested features. This validates findings of other authors and encourages developing new strategies with this new dataset as the benchmark.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>The number of elderly people living alone has been continuously growing worldwide. This independence comes with the risk of not receiving prompt attention if an accident occurs. A third of the people over 65 years old suffer on average one fall per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-sensors-17-00198">1</xref>], and this number grows with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-sensors-17-00198">2</xref>] and previous falls, where about one third develop fear of falling again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-sensors-17-00198">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-sensors-17-00198">4</xref>]. Not receiving attention in the first hour of the accident increases the risk of death and chronic affections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-sensors-17-00198">5</xref>]. This issue has been widely addressed in recent years with systems that detect falls in elderly people, and generate a prompt alert that can reduce the consequences related to medical attention response time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-sensors-17-00198">6</xref>]. These systems have acceptance among the objective population as a way to support their independence and reduce their fear of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-sensors-17-00198">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Developers of fall detection systems are currently facing several challenges. Independently of the acquisition strategy, most works are not tested with the objective population (elderly people), reducing their accuracy in real-life applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>]. Moreover, all public datasets exclusively contain data from young adults, making it difficult to test new proposals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-sensors-17-00198">9</xref>]. Here, we make publicly available a dataset with falls and activities of daily living (ADLs) acquired with a wearable device, and we provide results of some of the most commonly used detection features with both young and elderly people. The purpose of this work is to provide a benchmark for other researchers on the fall and movement detection field, and to address two rarely discussed open issues: training with young people features intended for elderly people, and setting-up algorithms for maximum accuracy instead of maximum sensitivity.</p>
      <p>Falls are commonly detected with wearable or ambient-based systems (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-sensors-17-00198">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-sensors-17-00198">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-sensors-17-00198">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-sensors-17-00198">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-sensors-17-00198">12</xref>] for reviews in the field). Ambient-based sensors such as cameras are intrusive and do not solve the problem for independent adults, who are not confined to closed spaces. According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-sensors-17-00198">2</xref>], up to 50% of the falls in independent elderly people occur outside the home premises. Wearable devices offer portability as they can be used regardless of the user location. Available wearable devices include smartphone apps and self-developed systems. In both cases, the preferred sensor is the triaxial accelerometer because of its low cost, small size, and because it is built-in in almost all smartphones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-sensors-17-00198">6</xref>]. Smartphones are a popular selection for authors because they include a robust hardware, a powerful processor, and they are economically affordable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-sensors-17-00198">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-sensors-17-00198">11</xref>]. However, the low cost of the individual components and design tools has encouraged authors to develop their own embedded devices too [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-sensors-17-00198">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>Independently of the device used, authors have faced problems such as energy consumption, battery life, false positives (the alarm turns on with ADL), false negatives (the alarm does not turn on with falls), and user comfort issues. Specifically for smartphones, these devices are not designed for constant use of the processor and sensors (the battery goes off in a couple of hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-sensors-17-00198">11</xref>]). Additionally, the smartphone may get hits and falls caused by manipulation, or the person may forget it in a table after calling, making it less feasible for permanent monitoring.</p>
      <p>New strategies for solving the aforementioned problems require testing. It requires acquiring datasets with common types of falls and ADLs. In this sense, some authors analyzed how elderly people fall. Back in 1993, authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-sensors-17-00198">5</xref>] performed a wide survey with 704 women over 65 years old. They reported that most falls were caused by trips, slips and loss of balance. However, they did not record data. About the conditions of the fall, in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-sensors-17-00198">14</xref>], the authors found that women were three times more likely to hit the ground on the hips than men, and that most people fell in a forward direction with 60% of prevalence. Most activities currently selected for testing algorithms are based on these studies.</p>
      <p>Once the selected ADL and falls are simulated and recorded, the raw acceleration data must be processed and classified. Authors commonly filter the data, apply a feature extraction, and classify activities as falls or ADL. The literature provides a wide number of features (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-sensors-17-00198">9</xref>], Table 4 and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-sensors-17-00198">12</xref>], Table 2 for complete lists). Unfortunately, there are not works in the literature tested with independent elderly people (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-sensors-17-00198">9</xref>], Table 1, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-sensors-17-00198">12</xref>], Table 4) and available public datasets were all recorded exclusively with young adults. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>], for example, authors tested 13 state-of-the-art approaches with real elderly people falls, and they found that the performance of these approaches severely decreased under real-life conditions. However, they did not release the validation dataset, i.e., other authors cannot analyze why those features reduced their performance, and, more importantly, how to solve it. To our knowledge, there only exist four public datasets, all acquired using smartphones: Mobifall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-sensors-17-00198">15</xref>], tFall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-sensors-17-00198">16</xref>], DLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-sensors-17-00198">17</xref>], and project gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-sensors-17-00198">18</xref>]. Igual et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-sensors-17-00198">19</xref>] compared the former three and found severe variability and performance issues of the analyzed algorithms.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we present and make publicly available a complete dataset of falls and ADL acquired with a self-developed embedded device that can be easily replicated (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-sensors-17-00198">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-sensors-17-00198">21</xref>] for example designs). It includes young adults and elderly people performing a wide variety of activities selected from a survey and previous studies. The dataset contains 19 types of ADLs and 15 types of falls. It includes acceleration (from two accelerometers) and rotation (from a gyroscope) data from 38 volunteers divided into two groups: 23 adults between 19 and 30 years old, and 15 elderly people between 60 and 75 years old. The dataset is available for free download as <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-sensors-17-00198">Supplementary Materials</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-sensors-17-00198">22</xref>], and videos of each type of activity within the dataset are also included for helping the reader to replicate this work. Additionally, a comparative analysis between several features used in the literature is presented as a reference for future works.</p>

      <title>2. Related Public Datasets</title>
      <p>Our search on public datasets of falls and ADLs was focused on wearable devices, as ambient based and video fall detection systems are too restrictive to help independent elderly people (the objective population of this work). We also considered some basic requirements for a dataset to be useful: all activities must be well documented, the raw data must be freely available, the dataset must contain both falls and ADLs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-sensors-17-00198">23</xref>], for example, examining several public datasets, but none including falls), and it must be reported in a peer-reviewed paper. Following these premises, we found four datasets:<list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>MobiFall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-sensors-17-00198">15</xref>]: twenty-four volunteers (22 to 42 years old) performed nine types of ADLs and four of falls using a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, Samsung, Seoul, South Korea. Nine subjects performed falls and ADLs, while 15 performed only falls (three trials each).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>tFall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-sensors-17-00198">16</xref>]: ten participants between 20 and 42 years old. They recorded eight types of falls (503 total recordings with two smartphones), and one week of continuous ADL recordings with all participants carrying smartphones in the pockets and a handbag. The ADL trials were not identified by activity.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>DLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-sensors-17-00198">17</xref>]: sixteen subjects (23 to 50 years old). They recorded six types of ADLs, and the authors did not specify the conditions of the falls (they belong to a single group). The files are too short for some types of analysis.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>Project gravity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-sensors-17-00198">18</xref>]: three participants (ages 22, 26, and 32) performed 12 types of falls and seven types of ADLs with a smartphone in the pocket.</p>
        </list-item>
      </list></p>
      <p>None of these datasets includes elderly people, and their variety of activities and number of subjects is limited compared to this work. Additionally, all authors used smartphones in the pocket for recordings. Here, we fixed our device as a belt buckle as recommended in previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-sensors-17-00198">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25-sensors-17-00198">25</xref>].</p>

        <title>3.1. Selection of Activities</title>
        <p>Additionally to those falls and ADLs commonly tested in the literature (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-sensors-17-00198">9</xref>], Table 4), we performed a survey with elderly people living alone and administrative personnel from retirement homes. The survey consisted of three main questions: For each fall incident, (<italic>i</italic>) which activity were you performing when the fall happened? (<italic>ii</italic>) What produced the fall? A sliding, a faint, a trip, other? (<italic>iii</italic>) In which orientation did the fall happen? What part of the body received the impact?. The survey was conducted with 15 elderly people from the psycho-physic program of the Universidad de Antioquia (between July and August 2014, in Medell&#xED;n, Colombia), and 17 retirement homes (between October 2014 and January 2015, in Medell&#xED;n and Manizales, Colombia).</p>
        <p>As a result of the survey, the independent elderly people fall more when walking, taking a shower, and walking up or down stairs; and fall less when trying to get up or sit down in a chair or a bed, or bending. On the other hand, elderly people living in retirement homes fall more when walking and when trying to get up from a chair or a bed and fall less when walking up or down stairs. The answers given by the participants were consistent with the results presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-sensors-17-00198">5</xref>]. <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00198-t001">Table 1</xref> shows the types of falls selected for this work. Falling when walking up or down stairs was identified as a common type of fall in the survey, but it was not included here because of the high risk of having an accident.</p>
        <p>ADLs of <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00198-t002">Table 2</xref> were selected based on: common activities, activities that are similar (in acceleration waveform) to falls, and activities with high acceleration that can generate false positives. All ADL and falls selected for this work were approved by a physician specialized in sports. The <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-sensors-17-00198">Supplementary Materials</xref> contains videos of each type of fall and ADL performed by the participants, as an effort to solve another drawback in the literature: showing the exact conditions of the recordings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-sensors-17-00198">22</xref>].</p>

        <title>3.2. Participants</title>
        <p>This database was generated with collaboration of 38 volunteers divided into two groups: elderly people and young adults. Elderly people group was formed by 15 participants (8 male and 7 female), and the young adults group was formed by 23 participants (11 male and 12 female). <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00198-t003">Table 3</xref> shows age, weight, and height of each group.

They all were healthy and independent, and none of them presented gait problems.</p>
        <p>Young adults performed ADLs and falls. Elderly people did not perform falls and activities D06, D13, D18, and D19 from <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00198-t002">Table 2</xref> due to recommendations of the physician specialized in sports. Additionally, some elderly people did not perform some activities due to personal impairments (or medical recommendation).

          <title>3.4.1. Preprocessing Stage</title>
          <p>Preprocessing is critical in the performance of the classification algorithms and their computational burden. In this work, we performed a comparison between using preprocessing or not in fall detection. The preprocessing stage consisted of a 4th order IIR Butterworth low-pass filter with cut-off frequency of 5 Hz. This filter was selected due to its simplicity, as it presented similar results than more elaborated IIR and FIR filters (including different cut-off frequencies) that we analyzed in preliminary tests.</p>

          <title>3.4.2. Feature Extraction</title>
          <p>The objective of this stage is to maximize the separation between ADL and falls. We tested several commonly used features listed in ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-sensors-17-00198">9</xref>], Table 4 and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-sensors-17-00198">12</xref>], Table 2) (original implementation details can be followed in the references therein). We separated the features in five groups: amplitude, orientation angle, statistical moments, critical phase time, and area under the curve. <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00198-t004">Table 4</xref> includes those features that presented the best overall performance.</p>

The position of the sensor in the center of mass of the body allows neglecting the vertical axis from the computation.

        <p>Regarding the other features, it is evident that not all of them improved their performance after filtering.

        </inline-formula> without the need of implementing a digital filter. Selecting the best fitted feature would depend on the embedded device used and the way they are implemented. Finally, orientation and time based features presented an overall poor performance (comparable to the sum vector magnitude).</p>
        <p>The inclusion of the filtering stage also defines the minimum allowed frequency sample. A preliminary analysis indicated that more elaborated filters or higher cut frequency values did not improve the accuracy. This result is meaningful as it suggests that a frequency sample of up to 11 Hz could be enough for fall detection (lower than any work in the literature), with its respective burden reduction. This gives an advantage to those features that performed better with the filter, given that the frequency sample is critical in wearable devices. This is because (<italic>i</italic>) the system remains more time in idle state; and (<italic>ii</italic>) more separation among samples allows more computations of the classifier. SisFall dataset was released with its original 200 Hz frequency sample, as a way to encourage other authors to obtain their own conclusions.</p>

These results coincide with those presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>]. It is noteworthy, as there are clear differences among the participants of both studies. The SisFall dataset we release in this work is intended to help develop fall detection algorithms for healthy independent elderly people, while authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>] obtained their dataset with highly impaired institutionalized Parkinson&#x2019;s patients.</p>
        <p>The generalized variation in sensitivity and specificity (which increased in validation with elderly people) suggests a shift in all activities with respect to the threshold. We performed a second comparative analysis to determine if the threshold is better adjusted when the algorithms are trained exclusively with elderly people. <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00198-t006">Table 6</xref> shows the validation accuracy of elderly people and threshold <inline-formula>

This result makes evident the need of including data from elderly people in the training stage, especially because after training with elderly people, the accuracy was still below the one obtained with young people.</p>
        <p>A close review of individual activities of SisFall provided the following findings: (<italic>i</italic>) ADLs and falls simulated by elderly people were smaller in amplitude than those simulated by young people. Then, algorithms trained with data from young people tended to bias the thresholds upwards in amplitude; (<italic>ii</italic>) most features tended to fail in the same activities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00198-f004">Figure 4</xref> shows box-plots of the maximum value obtained per activity with <inline-formula>

        <p>During this study, we observed differences in the way young adults behaved and fell with respect to elderly people. As previously stated by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-sensors-17-00198">28</xref>], the dynamics of simulated (mimicked) and real-world falls can be different. They found that young people simulating falls tend to do it faster without trying to avoid the impact. This behavior can be observed in the videos released as <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-sensors-17-00198">Supplementary Materials</xref> of this paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-sensors-17-00198">22</xref>]. On the other hand, because of his age and experience in Judo, the elderly person that performed falls always tried to cushion the hits, which is what we expect from someone having an undesired fall.</p>
        <p>We acknowledge that our dataset only includes simulated falls of one elderly person (subject SE06), who also is a Judo expert (not representative of the population). However, it allowed us to obtain five controlled repetitions of 15 different types of falls (for a total of 75 falls). Authors in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>] obtained 29 real falls, but they did not release them and their population was also distant from independent elderly people. Additionally, they did not provide detailed information about each fall condition. SisFall is the first public dataset that includes ADLs from elderly people and falls from an elderly person.</p>

      <title>5. Discussion</title>
      <p>Research on elderly fall detection lacks public datasets with activities and falls simulated by elderly people. Available datasets have few activities and none include falls from the objective population. In this paper, we presented and made publicly available the SisFall dataset. It consisted of up to 34 activities (falls and ADLs) that were performed by 38 participants with a wearable device fixed to their waist. One of the participants was an elderly person that simulated both ADL and falls. Together with the dataset, we included videos of all simulated activities as an effort to help other researchers to replicate this work.</p>
      <p>The SisFall dataset contains more participants, types of activities and recordings than any other publicly available dataset. It consists of 2706 ADL and 1798 falls, including data from 15 healthy independent elderly persons. To our knowledge, no public dataset contains data from elderly people, and their number of recordings is smaller (Mobifall: 342 ADLs and 288 falls; TFall: continuous ADLs and 240 falls; DLR: 961 ADLs and 56 falls; and Project Gravity: 138 ADLs and 72 falls).</p>
      <p>We developed and released this dataset as a benchmark for other authors in the field. In that sense, we tested it with some of the most widely used features to detect falls, with three proof-of-principle experiments: the effect of the preprocessing stage, the importance of including data from elderly people, and how a threshold focused on maximum sensitivity severely reduces the specificity. Explanations about preprocessing are commonly simplified in most approaches available in the literature. Here, with a simple 4th order Butterworth filter, we increased the accuracy of several features. However, not all features improved their performance, which is expected as they share an integral-based nature; but it is a fact not previously discussed in the literature. Nevertheless, preprocessing is crucial in fall detection as it defines the minimum acquisition frequency, which, in this work, we found to be at 11 Hz for those features that indeed improved with the filtering stage.</p>
      <p>In the second test, we analyzed the effect of training with young adults on a system developed to work with elderly people, which is usual in the field despite preliminary evidence that the results are biased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>]. Similar to this previous work, we found that the sensitivity is highly affected in all features once they are validated with the objective population. Note that Bagal&#xE0; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>] used 29 real falls of highly impaired Parkinson&#x2019;s patients. In our case, we used 75 falls under controlled conditions from a single independent elderly person, which is also a martial arts expert. It is noteworthy that, despite the large difference among validation sets, our results presented the same trend of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>]. Moreover, when the classifiers were trained with elderly people, the accuracy was still lower than with young people. These findings suggest that, due to the overall higher acceleration that young people show in all activities, including ADLs, and falls from elderly people, it is crucial to obtain proper results. Additionally, the lower accuracy obtained when training with elderly people suggests that there is a need of a better feature extraction.</p>
      <p>Developing a better feature extraction should be focused on specific activities. There are not many works focused on the types of falls elderly people suffer (most authors were limited to perform the same activities of previous works). However, the answers of our survey, previous works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-sensors-17-00198">5</xref>] and our findings suggest that if properly selected, authors could use a small sample of activities for their own tests. Performing an individual activity analysis (as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sensors-17-00198-f004">Figure 4</xref>) should help with the design of new features.</p>
      <p>Our final test consisted of placing the threshold (<inline-formula>

      </inline-formula>) below the fall value with minimum amplitude. In practice, fall detection systems are expected to detect all falls, while keeping the false positive rate as low as possible. Results of <xref ref-type="table" rid="sensors-17-00198-t007">Table 7</xref> presented poor results in all features. Note how a not too large increment in sensitivity caused significant reductions in specificity. This fact is noteworthy, as most works focus on maximizing accuracy instead of favoring fall detection. Authors that addressed this issue usually included a false-alarm button as part of their methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29-sensors-17-00198">29</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our dataset may be biased by two facts: (<italic>i</italic>) all of our falls were simulated (mimicked). Klenk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28-sensors-17-00198">28</xref>] stated that young people tend to fall faster than in real-life conditions; (<italic>ii</italic>) we only included falls from one independent elderly person; and, as a martial arts expert, this subject is not representative of the population. With respect to the first fact, the results of <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot2-sensors-17-00198">Section 4.2</xref> show that training with young people effectively shows higher accelerations. However, this difference can be quantified and corrected by comparing their mean acceleration per activity versus the elderly subjects on the same dataset. About the second fact, our falls from an elderly person (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot2-sensors-17-00198">Section 4.2</xref>) presented the same trend of a previous work that included real falls of impaired elderly people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-sensors-17-00198">8</xref>]. However, the crucial point here are the problems with obtaining real falls from healthy independent elderly people. In our case, we only had permission from the Ethics committee for simulating falls with one participant (SE06). Indeed, this participant always tried to soften the fall (as any person trying to avoid a fall would do). We consider that going farther with a wider and more realistic elderly fall dataset would be extremely challenging. Independent elderly people (the target of this work) fall on average once per year, i.e., to acquire a single fall would require a full year of continuous recording. Moreover, in this way, the actual conditions of the fall (activity, side of falling, etc.) may never be known. Despite these possible biases, we expect that this dataset will be a useful benchmark for other authors to test their own approaches and to solve the open issues presented in this work.</p>

      <title>6. Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this paper we presented and released SisFall, a fall and movement dataset acquired with 38 participants (15 of them elderly people). The data were acquired with an accelerometer fixed to their body. Along with this dataset we demonstrated that a 5 Hz fourth order filter keeps enough information for detecting falls on independent elderly people. Additionally, we showed that (as Bagal&#xE1; et al. stated for institutionalized impaired elderly people) training fall detection algorithms with young people is not adequate for detecting falls on independent elderly people. The main problem found is that young people simulate falls and ADL with more acceleration than the expected with elderly people. Finally, we showed why finding maximum accuracy in fall detection algorithms is not a good measure for real-life applications, where the sensibility of the system must be fitted to detect falls, while reducing the false positive rate as possible. However, all tested features presented poor results with this requisite.</p>
